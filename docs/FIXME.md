# Documentation Updates for Trading System

Based on our debugging work, we've identified several API mismatches between the documentation and the actual code implementation. This document outlines the necessary updates to make the documentation match the actual implementation.

## 1. Event System Module (`src/events/README.md`)

### Current Issues
- The documentation suggests that handlers can be registered without receiving an event object
- Method signatures don't match what the code expects

### Required Updates

#### Event Handler Registration
```markdown
When registering event handlers, all handlers must accept an event parameter:

```python
# CORRECT
def handle_bar(event):
    # Process event.data
    bar_data = event.data
    # Process bar data...

# INCORRECT - will cause errors
def handle_bar(bar_data):
    # Direct processing without event wrapper
    # This will fail!
```

#### Event Flow
The event flow section should clarify:
```markdown
1. All handlers must expect to receive an Event object, not just the data
2. Event handlers are responsible for extracting the data from the event:
   ```python
   def on_bar(self, event):
       bar_data = event.data
       # Process bar_data...
   ```
3. When emitting events, always wrap data in an Event object:
   ```python
   event_bus.emit(Event(EventType.BAR, bar_data))
   ```
```

## 2. Rules Module (`src/rules/README.md`)

### Current Issues
- The documentation shows rules being called with `generate_signal(data)` but the system expects `on_bar(event)`
- Example code in documentation doesn't match actual expected method signatures

### Required Updates

#### Rule Interface
```markdown
Rules must implement the `on_bar(event)` method which receives a bar event:

```python
class MyCustomRule(Rule):
    def on_bar(self, event):
        """
        Process a bar event and generate a signal.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        event : Event
            Event object containing bar data
            
        Returns:
        --------
        Signal or None
            A signal or None if no signal is generated
        """
        # Extract data from event
        data = event.data
        
        # Process data and generate signal
        # ...
        
        return signal
```

For backward compatibility, rules may also implement `generate_signal(data)`, 
but this method will only be called directly and not through the event system.
```

#### Signal Generation
```markdown
Signals should be returned directly from the `on_bar` method:

```python
def on_bar(self, event):
    data = event.data
    
    # Generate signal based on data
    if condition:
        return Signal(
            timestamp=data['timestamp'],
            signal_type=SignalType.BUY,
            price=data['Close'],
            rule_id=self.name,
            confidence=0.8
        )
    
    # Return None for no signal
    return None
```
```

## 3. Position Management Module (`src/position_management/README.md`)

### Current Issues
- The `open_position` method doesn't accept a `position_id` parameter as shown in documentation
- The Portfolio class doesn't have a `mark_to_market` method as implied

### Required Updates

#### Portfolio API
```markdown
### Opening Positions

```python
position = portfolio.open_position(
    symbol="AAPL",
    direction=1,  # Long
    quantity=100,
    entry_price=150.0,
    entry_time=datetime.now()
)
```

Note that the position ID is automatically generated by the Portfolio class.
```

#### Updating Position Values
```markdown
### Updating Position Values

The Portfolio tracks position values based on the most recent prices. To update
position values with current market prices, you must update each position's
`last_price` attribute and recalculate unrealized P&L:

```python
# Update a position with current price
for position in portfolio.positions.values():
    position.last_price = current_prices[position.symbol]
    
    # Recalculate P&L
    if position.direction > 0:  # Long
        pnl = (position.last_price - position.entry_price) * position.quantity
    else:  # Short
        pnl = (position.entry_price - position.last_price) * position.quantity
        
    position.unrealized_pnl = pnl
    position.unrealized_pnl_pct = pnl / (position.entry_price * position.quantity) * 100
```
```

## 4. Engine Module (`src/engine/README.md`)

### Current Issues
- The documentation doesn't clearly explain the flow of events through the system
- The role of the ExecutionEngine in updating portfolio state isn't clearly defined

### Required Updates

#### Event Flow
```markdown
## Event Flow in Backtesting

The complete event flow in the system follows this sequence:

1. `BAR` events are emitted for each bar of market data
2. Strategy components receive the bar events via their `on_bar(event)` methods
3. If a strategy generates a signal, it is emitted as a `SIGNAL` event
4. The PositionManager receives signal events via its `on_signal(event)` method
5. If the PositionManager decides to act on the signal, it generates an `ORDER` event
6. The ExecutionEngine receives order events via its `on_order(event)` method
7. The ExecutionEngine simulates execution and emits a `FILL` event
8. The Portfolio is updated with the fill information

This event flow ensures that each component is responsible only for its specific role
in the trading process.
```

#### Portfolio Updates
```markdown
### Updating Portfolio with Market Data

The ExecutionEngine is responsible for updating the portfolio with current market data:

```python
def update(self, bar_data):
    """
    Update portfolio with latest market data.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    bar_data : dict
        Current bar data with at minimum 'symbol' and 'Close' keys
    """
    # Update last known prices
    self.last_known_prices[bar_data['symbol']] = bar_data['Close']
    
    # Record portfolio state for history
    self._record_portfolio_state(bar_data['timestamp'])
```

This method should be called for each new bar to ensure the portfolio state
is updated with current market prices.
```

## 5. AlwaysBuyRule Implementation for Testing

Based on our debugging, we discovered that a simple rule that always generates buy signals
is useful for testing the system. Here's a reference implementation:

```python
class AlwaysBuyRule(Rule):
    """
    A debugging rule that always generates buy signals at a specified frequency.
    
    This rule is intended for testing and debugging purposes only, and should
    not be used for actual trading.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    frequency : int
        Generate a signal every 'frequency' bars (default: 2)
    confidence : float
        Confidence level for generated signals (default: 1.0)
    """
    
    @classmethod
    def default_params(cls):
        return {
            'frequency': 2,   # Generate signals more frequently for testing
            'confidence': 1.0  # Full confidence for testing
        }
    
    def __init__(self, name="always_buy", params=None, description=""):
        super().__init__(name, params or self.default_params(), description or "Debug rule that always generates buy signals")
        self.bar_count = 0
        self.last_signal = None
    
    def _validate_params(self):
        """Validate the parameters."""
        if self.params['frequency'] <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Frequency must be positive")
        if not 0 <= self.params['confidence'] <= 1:
            raise ValueError("Confidence must be between 0 and 1")
    
    def reset(self):
        """Reset the rule state."""
        super().reset()
        self.bar_count = 0
        self.last_signal = None
    
    def on_bar(self, event):
        """
        Process a bar event and potentially generate a signal.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        event : Event
            Event object containing bar data
            
        Returns:
        --------
        Signal or None
            A buy signal at the specified frequency, or None
        """
        # Get the data from the event
        data = event.data
        
        # Increment bar counter
        self.bar_count += 1
        
        # Get current bar info
        timestamp = data.get("timestamp")
        close_price = data.get("Close")
        
        # Generate a buy signal at the specified frequency
        if self.bar_count % self.params['frequency'] == 0:
            # Create signal object
            signal = Signal(
                timestamp=timestamp,
                signal_type=SignalType.BUY,
                price=close_price,
                rule_id=self.name,
                confidence=self.params['confidence'],
                metadata={"bar_count": self.bar_count}
            )
            
            # Store last signal
            self.last_signal = signal
            
            return signal
        
        # No signal for this bar
        return None
```

## 6. Summary of Key Insights

Throughout our debugging process, we learned:

1. **Event System Requirements**:
   - All event handlers must accept an event parameter
   - Handlers are responsible for extracting data from the event
   - Events must be properly emitted through the event bus

2. **Rule Implementation**:
   - Rules must implement the `on_bar(event)` method
   - Signals should be returned directly from the `on_bar` method
   - The bar_count must be maintained by the rule to track process

3. **Portfolio Management**:
   - Position IDs are auto-generated
   - Updates to position values require manual calculation of P&L
   - The portfolio needs proper updating to reflect current position values

4. **System Testing**:
   - The AlwaysBuyRule is essential for testing the full event flow
   - Position sizing needs careful management to avoid running out of capital
   - Performance metrics must include unrealized P&L
